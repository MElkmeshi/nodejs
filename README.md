# Nodemon-like Auto-Commit, Push, and Server Refresh
This project is inspired by the simplicity and convenience of Nodemon. It automatically detects when files are saved on your local machine, commits and pushes the changes to a GitHub repository, and triggers GitHub Actions to restart your server. The server then performs a git pull to fetch the updates and refreshes the code. With this tool, you can experience a seamless development and deployment process for your projects.
